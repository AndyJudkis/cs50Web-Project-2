# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

create a slack-like chat service using flask, javascript, and socket.io
to start, run python3 -m flask run

Well, my personal feature is to add a file upload/download feature. 
Some other features of note:
- if the server restarts, a channel will be recreated as necessary as messages come in on it
- if you hit enter after typing a text message, it's the same as clicking the enter button
- uses local storage to remember current channel and user ID
